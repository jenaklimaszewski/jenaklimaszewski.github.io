  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Jena Klimaszewski. I was born in Upstate New York, and am looking to relocate to the area after graduating this May. I am from Phoenix, NY, a small 
    canalside town. I completed my Bachelors degree at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts in May of 2024.  My undergraduate majors were Geography and 
    International Development.  Throughout my degree, I was able to learn a lot about urban planning theory, as well as effective ways to engage with diverse communities.  
    Currently, I am wrapping up my Masters degreee in Community Development and Planning at Clark. This program built on my existing skills, allowing me to use them at a higher level.
    Both of these programs allowed me to learn different ways of quantative analysis as well, including GIS. 
    After graduation, I am aspiring to be a community planner and am interested in building upon the existing strengths of towns and cities. I am a strong advocate for effective community
    engagment and participation. My core interests include creating affordable housing options, expanding public transit, and improving walkablity.
